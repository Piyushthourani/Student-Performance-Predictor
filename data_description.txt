Overview:
This dataset contains information about students' academic performance, study habits, and external factors affecting their final exam scores. It is designed for predictive modeling, data visualization, and educational analytics.

Dataset Purpose:
This dataset is useful for:

Predicting student final exam scores ðŸ“ˆ
Identifying key factors that impact academic performance ðŸŽ¯
Exploring feature importance in education-related datasets ðŸ“Š
Building machine learning models for regression and classification ðŸ¤–


Columns Description                 Column Name	Description

Student_ID:                     	Unique identifier for each student.
Gender:                         	Gender of the student (Male/Female).
Study_Hours_per_Week:           	Average number of study hours per week.
Attendance_Rate:	                Attendance percentage (50% - 100%).
Past_Exam_Scores:	                Average score of previous exams (50 - 100).
Parental_Education_Level:	        Education level of parents (High School, Bachelors, Masters, PhD).
Internet_Access_at_Home: 	        Whether the student has internet access at home (Yes/No).
Extracurricular_Activities: 	    Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes/No).
Final_Exam_Score (Target): 	        The final exam score of the student (50 - 100, integer values).

Ideas for Notebooks ðŸ“‘
Regression Analysis â€“ Predict final exam scores using machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Feature Importance â€“ Analyze which factors contribute the most to student performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualize the impact of study hours, attendance, and other features.
Classification â€“ Convert scores into categories (Pass/Fail, A/B/C/D) and build classification models.
